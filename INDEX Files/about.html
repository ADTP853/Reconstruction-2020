                </br><br>
                It's become a passion of mine to see a business thrive online, knowing that in some way I have helped in the
                process. It is such a satisfying feeling, so how did I get here....

                Well before learning to code and build websites, I spent 12 years in the military living the tankie life as
                part of the Royal Tank Regiment. I served one tour of Afghanistan and spent the last third of my career as a
                tank commander. The job, the people I met and the experience made for an incredible journey. There came a point
                though where I wanted a change.
                </br><br>
                My amazing wife was busy growing her own success as a branding photographer. Her business offered a
                chance to travel while meeting other exciting entrepreneurs. Bry's fun nomadic lifestyle made me crave a location
                free lifestyle for all of us. So after a 2 year self journey of going with the flow and searching for a similar 
                nomadic path of my own, I gained an interest into the world of coding. 
                </br><br>
                Come June 2019, after a year of hard studying, I launched my freelance web development business here at
                &lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt; which allows us the freedom to live the lifestyle we want.
