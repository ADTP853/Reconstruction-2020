                    Our pack has returned to the UK after our road trip through the southern states and waiting it out while 
                    the world experiences these strange times of the pandemic. Our home on wheels is waiting for us in Arizona.
                    Hopefully soon we'll be picking up where we left off!!

                    Hey, I'm Alec, founder of &lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt;. Since 2019 I've been building Memberships, Online Courses
                    and e-commerce websites. Helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses online by offering my expertise
                    around a range of services.
                    </br><br> 
                    It's become a passion of mine to see businesses thrive online, knowing that in some way I helped in the
                    process. It's such a satisfying feeling, so how did I get here.... 
                    </br><br>
                    Well, before learning to code and build websites, I spent 12 years in the military living the tankie life as
                    part of the Royal Tank Regiment. I served one tour of Afghanistan and spent the last third of my career as a
                    tank commander. 
                    </br><br>
                    I decided in 2015 I wanted a change. I had no idea how that looked, but I knew I wanted the option to live
                    location free with my wife Bry and our two little wolves (siberian huskies) Laika and Balto.
                    </br><br>
                    Come June 2019, after a long search for my next path and lots of hard studying, I launched my freelance web
                    development business here at &lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt; which allows us the freedom to live the lifestyle we want. 
                    </br><br>
                    It's been one hell of a journey. I've had the chance to work with incredible clients along the way helping
                    them overcome obstacles with their businesses online.
