                <h2>Hey, so let's get into what I do,</h2> </br><br>

                I’m a freelance web developer here to help you with the online side of your business. I build Websites,
                Memberships, Online courses and Multivendor e-commerce websites.</br><br>

                When getting your business online for the first time or even when you have an online presence, how often
                do you find yourself saying that things are complicated, overwhelming or that you just don’t know where
                to start. When you come to me with your vision, one of the many things I offer is project management. We
                talk about the ins and outs of what it is you want to achieve, then my military background kicks in. 
                Don’t worry, there’s no sudden physical training sessions or shouting to endure! I’m very good at taking
                note of your needs and mapping out your unique project from start to finish. If you have a tech team 
                around you, I can work alongside them too.</br><br>

                My aim is to make you feel at ease and get excited for the finished product, while feeling in safe hands.</br><br>

                Some quick geeky stuff…..I have a background knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS and PHP which means I’m able to
                manipulate projects, making them more unique to you. Platforms I’ve worked with:

                It’s important to note I'm a web developer and not a web designer which can get mixed up. I deal with
                both back and front ends but not your branding colours and fonts etc. I’ll either work alongside your designer,
                or use your predesigned theme/template, which I can help you source.</br><br>

                I cover all sections more in depth below and tell you what platforms I use to build them. My first choice in
                platforms may not be yours, that’s just human nature. If you have another platform in mind, I’m flexible to
                explore other ways. Can't see the section that relates to your online needs? That's ok, I'm not limited to these
                skill sets and work on various projects outside of these sections. So reach out to me here 
                <a alt="email" href="mailto:Alec@ontheroadcoder.com?subject=Project Enquiry">&lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt</a>, to
                talk about your unique project.</br><br>

                <h2>Memberships / Online courses:</h2></br><br></a>

                Not only can I build these from zero to hero, I can help with the running / updating of your current Memberships / Online Courses.
                I can also help you migrate from one platform to another.</br><br>

                What I hear a lot of when it comes to Memberships and Online courses is, “Which one is right for me?”. I know you’ve researched
                both types already but just to be sure, when we talk over your ideas and plans, if you’re still unsure I can advise on which is
                the right one for you.</br><br>

                I build on WordPress using the LMS (Learning Management System) LearnDash. Personally for the price and what LearnDash offers,
                I feel it's the right platform for anybody looking to spread knowledge for a  given subject online.</br><br>

                Selling Memberships and courses online is the next level in your business, let me help you get there.</br><br>

                If you need an online store to sell your own products or for a central hub for other vendors to sell theirs, this is something
                I can help you with.</br><br>

                It’s having your shop or better still, a shopping mall online. Either way it takes a lot of planning and organising to ensure
                your online store is branded correctly, processes sales smoothly and gives your customers a secure hub for their transactions.</br><br>

                For E-commerce websites I use Shopify which promotes your brand while handling your products securely. For Multivendor
                E-commerce websites I use Dokan with WooCommerce and WordPress, which gives both Vendors and Customers their own login account
                on your store.</br><br>

                I can help you organise the whole project from the very beginning or if you need your current online store upgrading, I provide
                services for that too.</br><br>

                When it comes to websites, there are a lot of easy ways to get yours up and running all by yourself…….so why come to me?</br><br>
    
                Put simply, I have the experience and knowledge to set you up on the right platform saving you both time and money.</br><br>
    
                I cover all angles of your website to ensure your brand is shining online, not just ‘online'. Anybody and their dog can put
                together a quick website, but there is a HUGE difference between knocking one up and doing it right.</br><br>
    
                I build websites that are personalised to you, giving you a unique, stand out platform online. The websites I build take into
                consideration the technologically advancing world, which means all sites can be viewed on any device, and are able to integrate
                with approved third-party programmes.</br><br>

                I use the platform Showit to build websites and link your blogs / journals with WP. The platform is SO user friendly which is
                my main reason for choosing this platform. After we complete your project, you have full control and ease for making minor
                - major adjustments.</br><br>

                As well as building websites from scratch, I can help you with the rebuilding / touch ups of your current site.</br><br>

                <h2>Custom coding:</h2></br><br></a>
    
                I started out in web development by learning how to code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Very quickly I learnt that coding takes a
                lot of will power, patience and attention to detail which as luck has it, meets my criteria. Every little corner of this website
                has been built and coded by me - NO templates - just pure code.</br><br>

                I have worked with clients that have had all sorts of website requirements. From the very basics of paragraphs being incorrectly
                spaced, or call to action buttons needing restyling. To the more advanced requirements such as applying visual effects to titles,
                or building an interactive FAQ’S section.</br><br>

                Coding allows many possibilities for your website to have them touch ups applied, or added content that your template doesn’t
                provide.</br><br>

                Take a look at some of my pre-built coded packages here:
