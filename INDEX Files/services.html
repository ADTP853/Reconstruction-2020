            <h3>Hey, so let's get into what I do,</h3> </br><br>

            I’m a freelance web developer here to help you with the online side of your business. I build Websites,
            Memberships, Online courses and Multivendor e-commerce websites.</br><br>

            When getting your business online for the first time or even when you have an online presence, how often
            do you find yourself saying that things are complicated, overwhelming or that you just don’t know where
            to start. When you come to me with your vision, one of the many things I offer is project management. We
            talk about the ins and outs of what it is you want to achieve, then my military background kicks in. 
            Don’t worry, there’s no sudden physical training sessions or shouting to endure! I’m very good at taking
            note of your needs and mapping out your unique project from start to finish. If you have a tech team 
            around you, I can work alongside them too.</br><br>

            My aim is to make you feel at ease and get excited for the finished product, while feeling in safe hands.</br><br>

            Some quick geeky stuff…..I have a background knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS and PHP which means I’m able to
            manipulate projects, making them more unique to you. Platforms I’ve worked with:
            <ul>
                <li>WordPress</li>
                <li>LearnDash</li>
                <li>Kajabi</li>
                <li>WooCommerce</li>
                <li>SamCart</li>
                <li>Elementor</li>
                <li>Showit</li>
                <li>Squarespace</li>
                <li>Wix</li>
                <li>Dokan</li>
                <li>Calendly</li>
                <li>Flodesk</li>
                <li>MailChimp</li>
            </ul>
            It’s important to note that I am a web developer and not a web designer which can get mixed up. I deal with
            both back and front ends but not your branding colours and fonts etc. I’ll either work alongside your designer,
            or use your predesigned theme/template you like, which I can help you source.</br><br>

            I cover all sections more in depth below and tell you what platforms I use to build them. My first choice in
            platforms may not be yours, that’s just human nature. If you have another platform in mind, I’m flexible to
            explore other ways. Can't see the section that relates to your online needs? That's ok, I'm not limited to these
            skill sets and work on various projects outside of these sections. So reach out to me here 
            <a alt="email" href="mailto:Alec@ontheroadcoder.com?subject=Project Enquiry">&lt;/onTheRoadCoder&gt</a>, to
            talk about your unique project.
